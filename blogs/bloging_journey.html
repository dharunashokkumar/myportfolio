            <h1>My Blogging Journey – How I Built My Blog & Applied for Adsense</h1>

            <h3>Hey friends,</h3>
            <p>Today I want to share the complete story of how I built my own blogging website from scratch and slowly started applying for Google Adsense. Honestly, I had zero knowledge when I started, but step by step I figured it out. If I can do it, you can also do it.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Why I Wanted to Start a Blog</h2>
            <p>At first, I was just doing small electronics projects and building websites for fun. But then I realized, "Why not share my journey online?" I wanted to write about my projects, my learnings, and also earn a little bit from it.</p>
            <p>That's when I decided to create a proper blog website. I didn't want to depend on anyone. I wanted full control of my website, design, and content.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Choosing Tech for My Blog</h2>
            <p>I started with the basics – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I didn't use WordPress or Blogger because I wanted to learn how things work under the hood.</p>
            <p>- HTML: To build the structure of the blog (pages, posts, links).</p>
            <p>- CSS: To make it look nice and mobile friendly.</p>
            <p>- JavaScript: To add interactivity and dynamic functions.</p>
            <p>Later, I integrated Firebase for storing my blog posts and handling the backend. Firebase was very beginner-friendly and allowed me to focus on the frontend design first.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Designing the Blog Layout</h2>
            <p>I spent a lot of time on how the blog should look. I didn't want it to be messy. So I created:</p>
            <p>- Homepage: List of latest posts with thumbnails.</p>
            <p>- Single Post Page: Each post opens with a proper title, image, and content.</p>
            <p>- Navigation bar: Simple and clean with "Home" and "About Me."</p>
            <p>- Footer: Links to my socials and basic copyright info.</p>
            <p>I made sure the design was mobile friendly, because most people read blogs from their phone.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Adding Blog Posts</h2>
            <p>Once the structure was ready, I started adding posts. This is the fun part! I wrote about my projects, experiments, and small tips.</p>
            <p>I used Firebase Firestore to store my blog data. Every post has:</p>
            <p>- Title</p>
            <p>- Content</p>
            <p>- Date</p>
            <p>- Thumbnail image</p>
            <p>Whenever a visitor opens my blog, it fetches the latest posts from Firebase and displays them. This was a huge learning experience for me.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Making My Blog SEO-Friendly</h2>
            <p>Google won't show your blog to others if it's not SEO-friendly. So I learned small SEO tricks:</p>
            <p>- Meta tags: I added proper meta description and keywords for each page.</p>
            <p>- Alt text for images: Google loves this.</p>
            <p>- Fast loading: I optimized images and removed unwanted code.</p>
            <p>- Mobile friendly: I tested using Google's mobile-friendly tool.</p>
            <p>I also checked my Lighthouse report (from Chrome DevTools) and improved whatever issues it showed.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Google Analytics & Monitoring</h2>
            <p>I wanted to see who visits my blog and from where. So I added Google Analytics.</p>
            <p>It was super simple: Sign up for Analytics → Copy the tracking code (gtag.js) → Paste it inside the head tag of my HTML</p>
            <p>Now I can track how many people visit, which posts are popular, and how they found my blog.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Applying for Google Adsense</h2>
            <p>Once I had a decent number of posts, I applied for Google Adsense. Adsense is the best way to show ads on your site and earn money.</p>
            <p>Here's how I did it:</p>
            <p>- Went to Google Adsense.</p>
            <p>- Signed up with my Gmail.</p>
            <p>- Added my blog URL for verification.</p>
            <p>- Placed the Adsense verification code in my site's head.</p>
            <p>- Submitted for review.</p>
            <p>Now, Google will check if my blog follows all the policies. It usually takes 2-3 weeks for approval.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
            <p>It was not an easy ride. Some problems I faced:</p>
            <p>- Broken image links: I forgot to upload images to my folder sometimes.</p>
            <p>- Console errors: While adding dynamic Firebase posts, I saw random errors.</p>
            <p>- Lighthouse report warnings: SEO and accessibility issues used to show up often.</p>
            <p>- Adsense rejection fear: I was scared Google will reject my site.</p>
            <p>But I kept fixing one issue at a time. I didn't rush.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>What I Learned in This Blogging Journey</h2>
            <p>- Content is king: Google wants original content. I write everything in my own words.</p>
            <p>- Consistency matters: You can't write one post and wait. Keep posting.</p>
            <p>- Design clean: Visitors should easily navigate.</p>
            <p>- Follow policies: No copied content, no illegal stuff, and don't trick users.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>My Current Blog Goals</h2>
            <p>I'm writing more posts (like this one you're reading now) to grow my blog. My target is to reach Adsense approval and then keep growing my traffic.</p>
            <p>I'm also improving my blog speed and design continuously. For example: Optimizing images, adding favicon and logo, improving mobile friendliness</p>
            <p>I want my blog to look and feel professional even though I built it on my own.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Advice for Beginners</h2>
            <p>If you want to start a blog, don't wait for the perfect time. Start now!</p>
            <p>- Use simple HTML/CSS or WordPress if you're not into coding.</p>
            <p>- Write about what you know or what you're learning.</p>
            <p>- Don't focus on earning on day 1. Build value first.</p>
            <p>One day, your blog will start getting visitors and you can monetize it.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>What's Next for Me</h2>
            <p>I'm planning to write at least 15+ quality blog posts and improve SEO. After Adsense approval, I'll experiment with affiliate marketing and maybe launch my own digital products.</p>
            <p>I'll also write about all my projects (electronics, AI assistant, servers, websites) on this blog. That way, others can learn and get inspired.</p>
