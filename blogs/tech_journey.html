      <h1>My Full Tech Journey – From Zero to Building Websites & Gadgets</h1>

      <p>Hey guys, I'm Dharun. Just a normal guy from Tamil Nadu who got curious about tech, slowly started doing small projects, and now I can proudly say I'm building my own websites, gadgets, and even my own company plans! It didn't happen overnight. I started literally from zero.</p>

      <h2>How It All Started – My "No Idea But Trying" Phase</h2>
      <p>To be honest, in the beginning, I was totally blank about tech. I didn't know what coding was or how websites worked. My journey started with small electronics like Arduino Uno, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi. I used to just connect wires randomly and upload code without knowing what's happening.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the projects would work by luck, sometimes they would fail badly. But I didn't give up. Slowly I started learning how things actually work.</p>

      <h2>My First Website Attempts – Old School Style</h2>
      <p>After playing with hardware, I got curious about websites. I started learning HTML and CSS. My first websites looked like they came from the 2000s. But at least I made something that worked on a browser.</p>
      <p>Then I learned JavaScript and how to make websites interactive. I tried to host my websites using platforms like Vercel and later used Firebase. I still remember the feeling when I saw my website live for the first time – mind blowing!</p>

      <h2>My Electronics Projects – Pure Trial and Error</h2>
      <p>Electronics was my big passion. I did a lot of small projects:</p>
      <p>- 16x2 LCD with Arduino Uno: Learned how to display text using an I2C module</p>
      <p>- RFID-RC522 sensor: I built an access system prototype using a Raspberry Pi</p>
      <p>- ESP32 camera module: I made it stream the camera feed accessible from anywhere</p>
      <p>- Milk vending machine prototype: I connected QR code scanning, a website interface, and milk dispensing (tested with LED first)</p>
      <p>Most of these were pure trial and error, but every small success gave me confidence.</p>

      <h2>My Cloud and Server Setup Experiments</h2>
      <p>Once I got my Raspberry Pi 4, I wanted to do big things. I tried to make my own cloud server using the Pi and some pendrives as storage. I learned about DDNS using Dynu, and how to access my files from anywhere.</p>
      <p>Later, I also tried TrueNAS to set up a proper file server inside my home Wi-Fi. I didn't want to mess with port forwarding, so I learned Cloudflare tunnel tricks.</p>

      <h2>AI & Software Side of My Journey</h2>
      <p>Recently, I started working on a dream project – my own AI Assistant. I want to create something like Cuely, an assistant that pops up with a shortcut (Ctrl + \) on my PC, can see my screen using OCR, and help me during interviews by giving suggestions.</p>
      <p>I'm building it using Electron, ChatGPT API, and OCR tools. It's tough, but I love the challenge.</p>

      <h2>My Company Dream – TripleETech</h2>
      <p>All this led me to start my own company idea called TripleETech. First, I'll provide website creation services for small businesses. Then I'll slowly expand into IT services, marketing, electronics, server management, and cybersecurity.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned in This Journey</h2>
      <p>- Start small: Don't wait for everything to be perfect</p>
      <p>- Trial and error is the only way: I failed many times but learned a lot</p>
      <p>- Ask questions: Whenever I got stuck, I asked and searched until I got the answer</p>
      <p>- Keep upgrading: I didn't stop at HTML. I moved to JS, hosting, SEO, hardware, cloud, and AI step by step</p>

      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      <p>I will keep posting all my projects, tips, and stories here. If you're also starting from zero like me, don't overthink. Just start. Play with small projects, build a simple website, try a small sensor project. One day, you'll surprise yourself.</p>
