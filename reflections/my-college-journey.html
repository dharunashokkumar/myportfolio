<p>JEE Advanced didn't go as planned. The results came in, and I had optionsIIIT Kalyani, IIIT Dharwad, IIIT Vadodarabut only for Mechanical or Civil Engineering. Not Computer Science, which is what I wanted. This is the story of how I chose a different path, and why "better to be the head of a cat than the tail of a tiger" became my philosophy.</p>

<h2>The JEE Journey</h2>

<p>Like millions of Indian students, I spent two years preparing for JEE with hopes of securing a seat in a top engineering college. The journey was intensecoaching classes, mock tests, late nights solving problems, and the constant pressure of expectations.</p>

<p>When results came out, I had secured seats at some IIITs, which many would consider a success. But there was a catch: only Mechanical Engineering or Civil Engineering were available, not the Computer Science I had dreamed of studying.</p>

<h2>The Decision Point</h2>

<p>I faced a choice:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> Take Mechanical/Civil at an IIIT, hope for branch change (difficult, competitive)</li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Take a drop year, prepare again, aim for better rank</li>
<li><strong>Option C:</strong> Choose CSE at a private university like LPU</li>
</ul>

<p>Many people advised Option Atake the IIIT seat, they said, the brand name matters. Others suggested a drop year. But I chose Option C, and here's why.</p>

<h2>Why LPU?</h2>

<h3>The Philosophy: Head of a Cat vs Tail of a Tiger</h3>

<p>There's an old saying: "Better to be the head of a cat than the tail of a tiger." In a highly competitive IIIT environment where I'd be studying a branch I'm not passionate about, I'd be struggling to survive. At LPU, in the program I actually wantComputer ScienceI could thrive, lead, and build something meaningful.</p>

<p>Success isn't just about the institution's name. It's about what you make of your opportunities.</p>

<h3>1. World-Class Infrastructure</h3>

<p>LPU's campus is genuinely impressive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern labs with latest equipment</li>
<li>High-speed internet across campus</li>
<li>Dedicated maker spaces and innovation labs</li>
<li>Libraries with extensive digital resources</li>
<li>Sports facilities that rival any university</li>
</ul>

<p>Having the tools and resources to learn and build projects matters more than many realize.</p>

<h3>2. CSE Curriculum That Matches My Interests</h3>

<p>LPU's CSE program covers exactly what I want to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AI and Machine Learning</strong>  The future of technology</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>  A field I'm actively exploring</li>
<li><strong>Web Development</strong>  Building on my existing skills</li>
<li><strong>IoT</strong>  Connecting my electronics knowledge with programming</li>
<li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>  Foundation for technical interviews</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing</strong>  Scaling my personal server knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare this to struggling through Thermodynamics or Structural Analysis in a branch I have no interest in.</p>

<h3>3. Placement Opportunities</h3>

<p>While LPU doesn't have the automatic prestige of IITs, the placement record for CSE is solid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Major companies recruit from campus (TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Cognizant)</li>
<li>Growing presence of product companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google for select students)</li>
<li>Average package is decent, high package can be impressive</li>
<li><strong>Key insight:</strong> In CSE, your skills matter more than your college brand</li>
</ul>

<p>A strong GitHub portfolio, competitive programming profile, and real projects can open doors anywhere.</p>

<h3>4. Freedom to Build and Experiment</h3>

<p>At LPU, I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Join hackathons and coding competitions</li>
<li>Access entrepreneurship cells and startup incubators</li>
<li>Participate in technical clubs and societies</li>
<li>Work on personal projects without the pressure of branch change</li>
<li>Focus on building skills, not just surviving in wrong domain</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Peer Learning and Collaboration</h3>

<p>Being in CSE means I'm surrounded by people who share my interests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coding together, learning from each other</li>
<li>Collaborative projects and hackathons</li>
<li>Sharing resources, tutorials, opportunities</li>
<li>Building networks in the tech community</li>
</ul>

<p>This matters more than being in a marginally more "prestigious" college studying something I don't care about.</p>

<h2>My College Plans</h2>

<h3>Academic Goals</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Project Goals</h3>

<h4>DadsCloud</h4>
<p>Scaling my personal Raspberry Pi cloud server project:</p>
<ul>

<li>Add features like automated backups, file versioning</li>
<li>Implement proper user management</li>
<li>Potentially productize for others to use</li>
</ul>

<h4>TripleETech</h4>

<li><strong>Networking:</strong> Build connections with seniors, alumni, industry professionals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Redefining Success</h2>

<p>Many people measure success by college rank or package numbers. I see it differently:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Success is doing what you love</strong>  CSE, not Mechanical</li>
<li><strong>Success is continuous growth</strong>  Learning and building constantly</li>
<li><strong>Success is creating value</strong>  Projects that solve real problems</li>
<li><strong>Success is freedom</strong>  Working on your own terms</li>
<li><strong>Success is impact</strong>  Helping others along the way</li>
</ul>

<p>In four years, I won't be measured by which college I attended, but by:</p>

<ul>
<li>What I built</li>
<li>What I learned</li>
<li>What problems I solved</li>
<li>What value I created</li>
</ul>

<h2>Message to Others in Similar Situations</h2>

<h3>If You Didn't Get Your Dream College</h3>

<p>It's not the end. College is four years; your career is 40+ years. What you learn and build matters infinitely more than the name on your degree.</p>

<ul>
<li>A mediocre student at IIT with no real skills will struggle</li>
<li>An excellent student at any college with strong skills will succeed</li>
<li>The difference is effort, not institution</li>
</ul>

<h3>If You're Choosing Between Brand and Branch</h3>

<p>Choose branch over brand if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're passionate about the field</li>
<li>The branch aligns with your career goals</li>
<li>You have the discipline to self-learn and build</li>
<li>You value doing what you love over prestige</li>
</ul>

<p>Brand matters less in tech than in traditional fields. Your GitHub, your projects, your skillsthese speak louder than your college name.</p>

<h3>If You're Considering a Drop Year</h3>

<p>Ask yourself honestly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will one more year of preparation significantly improve my rank?</li>
<li>Am I running toward something or away from something?</li>
<li>Could I use that year learning actual skills instead?</li>
<li>What's the opportunity cost of delaying college by a year?</li>
</ul>

<p>There's no right answer, but make sure it's your decision, not society's.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>In India, we're conditioned to believe in a linear path: JEE ’ IIT ’ Package ’ Success.</p>

<p>But look at the real world:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many successful entrepreneurs didn't attend IIT</li>
<li>Many IIT grads struggle to find their passion</li>
<li>Your 12th-grade exam doesn't determine your life trajectory</li>
<li>Skills, creativity, and perseverance matter more than rank</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure isn't failing to get into IIT. Failure is spending four years studying something you hate.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>I chose LPU because it gives me what I need:</p>

<ul>
<li>The branch I'm passionate about</li>
<li>Resources to learn and build</li>
<li>Freedom to explore and experiment</li>
<li>Opportunity to lead and make an impact</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest is up to me. No college, not even IIT, can guarantee success. And no college, including non-IITs, can prevent it if you're determined enough.</p>

<p>My journey starts herein the program I chose, pursuing the field I love, building the projects I care about. JEE might not have gone as planned, but sometimes the detour leads to a better destination.</p>

<p>Better to be the head of a cat than the tail of a tiger. Let's see where this path leads.</p>
